# Statistics for Data Science

## Worldwide Suicide Rates Analysis and Prediction

This repository is focused on statistics, data exploration, and analysis using R.  The capstone project was focused on analysis of worldwide suicide rates and demographics.  The final portion was to attempt a machine learning algorithm to predict a suicide rate.

## Project Background

Suicide has become a topic of interest in recent years and in general, either through increased attention or increased suicide attempts, the perception is that suicide is becoming more prevalent.  Completed suicide attempts affect our world in innumerable ways including emotional, socioeconomic, and personal levels.  For my final project in this course, I sought out to further explore suicide data and trends, perhaps as a way to see if there were certain factors that are predictive of suicide rates.  The dataset is a Suicide Rates Overview from 1985-2016 obtained from Kaggle.com.  This is a composite dataset with various demographic characteristics compiled from 4 different sources.
